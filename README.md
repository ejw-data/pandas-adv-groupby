# Pandas Groupby Operations

> Purpose:  Often people don't realize that tasks sometimes done with for loops can actaully be done in pandas if the pattern is consistent.  If more complex conditions are needed then a for loop would be necessary or a multistep solutin needed with pandas.

### Objective
In this file, we import in a file of historical songs and their annual rankings by year.  The data file has several issues that need resolved before applying a groupby.  

An example of how to use pandas dataframes to find ordered data is provided.  In this case, we order the data by the 'Annual Ranking' and then find the first two rows of each year.  This is a nice example that shows how groupby's work.
